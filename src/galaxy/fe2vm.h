/*
 * fe2vm.h - runs Frontier: Elite 2's own code (the 68k code translated to
 * C, Start680x0_at) for the galaxy atlas, so everything it shows is
 * computed by the game itself, not by a copy of its maths.
 *
 * Two ways to run (fe2vm.c):
 *  - the standalone viewer (FE2GALAXY_TOOL): fe2vm_init() loads the game
 *    binary like the game does and runs the start of its setup; the tool
 *    owns the machine.
 *  - inside the running game: the machine is the game's, stopped in one of
 *    its host calls while the menu draws. Calls go between fe2vm_begin()
 *    and fe2vm_end(), which save the machine (registers, flags, interrupt
 *    state, the game memory the calls may write) and put it all back, so
 *    the game carries on as if nothing happened.
 *
 * fe2vm_call() runs any game subroutine: registers in, registers out. The
 * host calls the game makes while it runs are the atlas's (text capture and
 * the drawing ones below); the rest do nothing.
 *
 * Not thread safe: the game has one set of registers and one RAM.
