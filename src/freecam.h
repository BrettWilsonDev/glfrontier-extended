/*
 * freecam.h - free camera: pauses the game and flies a camera around the
 * player's ship (the Lfreecam_ mod in fe2/fe2_modded.s).
 *
 * Keys: Ctrl-V on / off, Esc off, W/S forward / back, A/D left / right,
 * R/F up / down, arrows (or mouse with a button held) look, Q/E roll,
 * +/- or mouse wheel speed, Shift fast, H hide / show the help box.
 *
 * Touch controls (when they are on): drag on the left half moves (a
 * thumbstick that starts where you press), drag on the right half looks,
 * buttons for up / down, roll, speed, help and exit. Like the other touch
 * controls they are pressed with the mouse (SDL's mouse is also the first
 * finger), so they work with a mouse too; a second finger can look around
 * while the first holds the stick.
