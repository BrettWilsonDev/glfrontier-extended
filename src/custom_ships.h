/*
 * custom_ships.h - custom 3D models (the "Custom ship models" mod, Lmdlmod_ in
 * fe2/fe2_modded.s).
 *
 * At startup, after the game binary is in RAM, every tools/fe2ShipBuilder/custom_ships/NNN.fe2m
 * file (NNN = model number, 000-511) is copied into the game's model pool
 * and the model numbers it holds are pointed at the copies, so the game
 * draws (and flies, and collides with) those instead of its own. The files
 * are compiled into the executable (CMakeLists.txt), so it stays one
 * standalone file; build them with tools/fe2ShipBuilder (FE2ShipBuilder.exe).
 *
 * .fe2m format, all big endian:
 *   "FE2M"  u16 version (1 or 2)  u16 model count
 *   per model: u16 model number, u16 reserved, u32 byte length, then the
 *   model exactly as the game stores it (header, vertices, normals, code,
 *   collision, ship data; offsets relative to its first byte), padded to
 *   an even length.
 *   version 2 then has u16 record count, and per record u16 type, u16
 *   length, data padded to even, all about the first model:
 *     1 name     ASCII ship name (becomes core string $4070 + n)
 *     2 like     u16 original model number the new ship behaves like
 *     3 picks    (u8 category, u8 weight) pairs: L5fac2_ship_picks lists
 *                the ship joins - shipyards, traders, pirates, police...
 *
 * New ship types use model numbers 240-511 (FE2ShipBuilder: ships from 240 up,
 * parts of big ships from 511 down): see "MOD Custom ship models, part
 * 2" in fe2_modded.s.
 *
 * Does nothing in the original game build (GLF_MODDED_FE2 off).
